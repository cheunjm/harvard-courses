    "# Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will write a closure to make writing messages easier.  Suppose you write the following message all the time: \n",
    "```python \n",
    "print(\"The correct answer is: {0:17.16f}\".format(answer))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Wouldn't it be nicer to just write \n",
    "```python \n",
    "correct_answer_is(answer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "and have the message?  Your task is to write a closure to accomplish that.  Here's how everything should work:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "correct_answer_is = my_message(message)\n",
    "correct_answer_is(answer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output should be: `The correct answer is:  42.0000000000000000.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now change the message to something else.  Notice that you don't need to re-write everything.  You simply need to get a new message function from `my_message` and invoke your new function when you want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should feel free to modify this in any way you like.  Creativity is encouraged!"
