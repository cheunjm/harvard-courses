    "You can nest the definitions of functions. When you do this, inner function definitions are not even evaluated until the outer function is called. These inner functions have access to the name bindings in the scope of the outer function. In the example below, in `make_statement`, both `s` and `key` will be defined. And in `key`, you have access to `s`. This sharing is called *lexical scoping*. "

    "\n",
    "The reason this works is that in addition to the environment in which a user-defined function is running, that function has access to a second environment: the environment in which the function was defined.  Here, `key` has access to the environment of `make_statement`. In this sense the environment of `make_statement` is the parent of the environment of `key`.\n",

    "Basically, we wrote a nice function to \"decorate\" our function of interest.  In this case, we wrote a timer function whose closure wrapped up any function we gave to it in a timing construct.  In order to invoke our nice decorations, we had to pass a function to the timer function and get a new, decorated function back.  Then we called the decorated function.\n",
