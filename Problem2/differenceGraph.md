I chose to calculate the mean value and first show it in the original line graph and use it to make 2 seperate plots that shows the residuals between the each consensus number and the mean in two seperate scales: absolute and relative. The visualization allows to see the ambiguity in the data by showing the residual and showing how much it is different from the mean. I chose this over the power scale I was thinking of because it can more easily show the difference. Moreover, because it is centered around the mean, it allows to compare one consensus value from another. Overall, it was a success, even though I didn't have the time to finish the mouse hover function I wanted to implement.
