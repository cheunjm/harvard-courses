    "The following little program needs some documentation and some tests.  Since you didn't write it, I'll tell you what it's supposed to do.  You'll need to document it.  Feel free to test for additional exceptions if you have time but start with it as it is.\n",

    "The point of the program is to compute the $L_{2}$ norm of a vector $v$.  A second argument, if provided, will be interpreted as a vector of weights.  The second argument must have the same length as the input vector.\n",
