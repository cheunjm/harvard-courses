# CS207 Course Repository

This is the Fall 2018 CS207 course repo.

Please consult the course website [https://iacs-cs-207.github.io/cs207-F18/](https://iacs-cs-207.github.io/cs207-F18/) for specific course details
including the syllabus, course policies, course schedule, and additional resources.

## Course Workflow

All of your work (except for the class project) will be hosted on your private GitHub repo named `githubusername/cs207_<firstname>_<lastname>`. This
repo will be a clone (or fork) of the main course repo. We will discuss how to set this up in the first lecture or two.

It is critical that you set up a private repo (free for students) and give the teaching staff access. There are two reasons for keeping this repo
private. One is so that other students cannot see your work. The other reason is because the teaching staff will be providing comments and you may not
want other students to see these.

The `GitHub` usernames for the teaching staff are:
* dsondak
* bkleyn
* shiyunqiu
* lee709
* brafetto
* yiqixie94

When you arrive at each class, you should pull from the base course repo. Make sure you push all changes to your repo before each deadline. We
will be able to see if youâ€™ve submitted your work on time or not.

The class project will be done in groups of 3 to 4. You should create a GitHub organization with your group members and teaching staff in it. The
organization will be called `cs207_groupname` and the project repo should be called `project`. The group is free to make other repos within the
organization for experiments, but `project` is the one we will grade.
