Introducing IntelFlash: Flash Cards equipped with Artificial Intelligence

1. From your current working directory, go to the directory where the folder intelflash lives.

2. On your command line, run 'python intelflash'

3. If this is your first time, you can choose to add a new deck of cards (if not, skip to 4). Press 2 then enter and add cards by first naming your deck, and adding a question and answer every time you are prompted. If you wish to stop, simply type quit then enter. If your directory is somehow not in the right place, make sure to move your flashcards folder into intelflash.

4. In order to study your flashcards, press 1 then enter, then choose which deck to study, and then type in how many minutes you want to study the cards. Intelflash will show you flashcards based on its algorithm until the time is up, or if you want to quit at any point, simply press enter without an input and the quiz will stop.

Happy Studying!
