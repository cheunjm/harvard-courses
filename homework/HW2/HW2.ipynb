    "### Problem 1 [5 pts]:  `Git` and recovering from a mistake\n",
    "Here's the scenario for this problem.  In Lecture, you created a branch in your `playground` repo called `mybranch1`.  You worked on `mybranch1` and created a file called `books.md`, but you never merged that file into your `master` branch.  In fact, we'll operate under the assumption that you really *don't* want to merge `books.md` into `master` yet.  However, being human, you are bound to make mistakes.  In this problem, you will clone `playground` and forget to switch to `mybranch1`.  You will accidentally pull `books.md` into `master`.  Then, you will recover from this mistake by reverting `master` to an earlier state; one that doesn't have `books.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will do this problem in the `Jupyter` notebook so we can see your output.  Once again, you will work with your `playground` repository (created and explored in Lectures 2 and 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** At the beginning of each `Jupyter` notebook cell, you MUST type `%%bash`.  If you don't do that then you will not be able to work with the necessary bash commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the following steps for this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First cell:\n",
    "  1. Type `cd /tmp` to enter the temporary directory\n",
    "  2. `git clone <url to your playground repo>` <br>\n",
    "  **Note:** If you want to re-clone the repo (after you already cloned it), make sure you delete the old repo using `rm -r /tmp/playground`.\n",
    "2. Second cell:\n",
    "  1. Go into your local `playground` directory (`cd /tmp/playground`)\n",
    "  2. Type `git pull origin mybranch1`\n",
    "  3. `ls` <br>\n",
    "  Uh oh!  `books.md` is now in your `master` branch!\n",
    "3. Third cell:\n",
    "  1. Go into your local `playground` directory (`cd /tmp/playground`)\n",
    "  2. Type `git status` <br>\n",
    "  Your local `master` branch is now ahead of the remote `master`!\n",
    "4. Fourth cell:\n",
    "  1. Go into your local `playground` directory (`cd /tmp/playground`)\n",
    "  2. Type `git reset --hard origin/master`\n",
    "  3. `ls` <br>\n",
    "  `books.md` is gone!\n",
    "5. Fifth cell:\n",
    "  1. Go into your local `playground` directory (`cd /tmp/playground`)\n",
    "  2. Type `git status` <br>\n",
    "  Everything is back to normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of this problem was to show you how to get your local repo back to an earlier state.  In this exercise, you accidentally merged something to `master` that you didn't want.  Rather than starting to delete things all over the place, you can simply reset your `HEAD` to a previous commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT!** This is a proper `git` workflow.  DO NOT start deleting, rebasing, or re-cloning everything.  Take one step at a time, think about the decisions you're making, and execute deliberately.  It will take a little practice in the beginning, but time spent now will translate to lots of time saved later."

    "### Problem 2 [5 pts]:  `Git` and checking out a single file\n",
    "Sometimes you don't want to merge an entire branch from the upstream but just one file from it. There is a direct use case for such a situation. Suppose I've made an error in this homework (or a lecture) and want to correct it. I fix the mistake in the upstream repo. In the meantime you have edited some other files and you really don't want to manually ignore my older copies of those files. Rather, you want to fix just one file from this new branch. This is how you do it.\n",

    "  2. `cat README.md`.  This just looks at the updated file.\n",
    "3. Third cell:\n",
    "  1. `git status`\n",

    "\n",
    "**a).**\n",
    "Write a closure to make withdraws from a bank account.  The outer function should be accept the initial balance as an argument (I'll refer to this argument as `balance` in this problem statement, but you can call it whatever you want).  The inner function should accept the withdraw amount as an argument and return the new balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE 1:** For this part, do not try to reassign `balance` in the inner function.  Just see what happens when you return a new balance.  You can store the new balance in a new name (call it `new_bal` if you want) or just return the new balance directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE 2:** You should check for basic exceptions (e.g. attempting to withdraw more than the current balance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you write your functions, demo them in your notebook as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "wd = make_withdraw(init_balance)\n",
    "wd(withdraw_amount)\n",
    "wd(new_withdraw_amount)\n",
    "```\n",

    "**c).**\n",
    "Now make just one small change to your code from Part b.  Declare `balance` as a nonlocal variable using the `nonlocal` keyword.  That is, before you get to the inner function, say `nonlocal balance`.  Here's some information on the `nonlocal` statement:  [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now test things out like you did in Part a.  It should be behaving correctly now.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's return to the data from Problem 4.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Write two functions: \n",
    "1. The first function should return the average circle radius (you can re-use the one you already wrote if you'd like, but you might need to update it slightly for this problem).\n",
    "2. The second function should just use `numpy` to compute the average.\n",

    "#### Notes and Hints\n",
    "1. Be fair!\n",
    "2. To be as fair as possible, do the following:\n",
    "  1. Create an `areas` list/array _outside_ of your averaging functions.  This means that you should do a loop over the radii you read in from `circles.txt`, compute the area from each point, and store that area in an array.  Do you know why this is more fair?  If not, think about it make sure you understand.  Also, do not use `append`.  Instead, preallocate space for your `area` list/array.\n",
    "  2. Your `my_ave` function should accept your areas data as a list.  Remember, to allocate a list you should do `[0.0]*N`: if you use such a construct your list will be filled in with $N$ zeros.\n",
    "  3. Your `np_ave` function should accept your areas data as a `numpy` array.  To allocate a `numpy` array do `areas_np = np.zeros(len(radii))`.\n",
