    "\n",
    "Do the following:\n",
    "1. Make a [markdown table](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables) that shows the evaluation procedure for $f\\left(a\\right)$ where $a = \\left(1, 2, 3\\right)$.  The final row should contain the value of $f\\left(1, 2, 3\\right)$.\n",
    "  - Feel free to write out the computational graph if you'd like.  However, that is not necessary to get full credit for this exercise.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Extend the markdown table to include columns for $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$, $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$, and $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$ and fill in with the values (also evaluated at $a = \\left(1, 2, 3\\right)$.\n",

    "We discussed documentation and testing in lecture and also briefly touched on code coverage.  You must write tests for your code in your final project (and in life).

    "1. You work on your part of the code in your own branch or fork\n",
    "2. On every commit you make and push to GitHub, your code is automatically tested by an external service (e.g. Travis CI). This ensures that there are no specific dependencies on the structure of your machine that your code needs to run and also ensures that your changes are sane\n",
